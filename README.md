A python script that connects to the [vulners.com](https://gist.github.com/athityakumar/1bd5e9e24cd2a1891565573a893993eb) API to pull in all security vulnerabilities that apply to your setup.
\
This is the backend responsible for the following:-

- Connecting to the API to get a list of all the types of vulnerabilities i.e. Cisco, Linux, Windows etc.
- Putting these into a SQLite DB so that they can be selected or deselected from the frontend
- Downloading the relevant .zip files from vulners and storing them in a folder to be accessed by the front end.

# Usage
To use the backend run `python3 main.py` from within the main directory of the script or setup a crontab job to do this,\
i.e. `0 1 * * 0-6 python3 /root/bin/vuln_backend/main.py >/dev/null 2>&1`

# Installation

Download the Zip of the script and extract to an easily accessible folder i.e. `/root/bin/vuln_backend`

You will need to setup the MySQL/MariaDB and MongoDB databases.

Thos MongoDB database is named `vulnerabilities` and this will need a collection named `vuln_sets`

Rename config.ini.example to config.ini and change the following values to your values:

DB_SERVER = dbserver
DB_USER = dbuser
DB_PWD = dbpass
DB_NAME = database

MONGO_SERVER = mongoserver
MONGO_PORT = 27017



Navigate to the installation directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
